# Algorithmic Problem Analyzer

## Overview
This project analyzes how algorithm performance changes with increasing input sizes.
Instead of relying only on theoretical time complexity, it measures real execution time
to build an intuitive understanding of algorithm efficiency.

## Algorithms Analyzed
- Bubble Sort (O(n²))
- Binary Search (O(log n))

## How It Works
1. Generates random arrays of increasing size
2. Runs each algorithm on the input
3. Measures execution time using Python's time module
4. Displays how runtime grows with input size

## Why This Project
Understanding performance is critical in real-world software engineering.
This project helped me connect theoretical Big-O notation with actual runtime behavior.
